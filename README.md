# Solana Debugger: Delta counter program example

This repository stores an example program meant to be used with the Solana Debugger.

The `debug_input` folder contains a few sample debugger inputs that can be directly used.

It contains the `save_input` module, which means you can use tests to generate new debugger inputs.
